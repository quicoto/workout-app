## Mission

Don't worry about your workout rutines anymore, let the app work for you.

## No backend

From 2.0.0 onwards we've removed Firebase and we're doing a static json database file.

The file has to be updated from the output generated in the admin.

### Rationale

Remove the firebase dependency, forget about quotas, billings... just serve static content.
